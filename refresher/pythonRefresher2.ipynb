Thus, if the first part of an `and` operation is `False` (or, conversely `True` for an `or` operation), the remaining part of the statement will not be processed since the overall result will be `False`. This approach is known as _short-circuiting_ and can produce faster code execution; however, it can easily lead to confusion if you perform function calls or variable creation in the latter parts of a conditional statement.\n",

    "When a function is called, Python creates a new environment for that function. The new environment inherits everything from its calling environment. Any arguments to the functionare created as variables in the function's environment. Those variables, and the function's environment, are deleted once the function returns a value or finishes execution. Functions may reference variables in their calling environment. However, if a function attempts to alter a variable in its calling environment, Python will create a new local variable with the same name. Any changes made to the local variable do not affect the calling environment. This subtlety is illustrated with the example below."
