    "One of the early criticisms from many people in the data science arena surrounding the use of the Python language was the lack of useful data structures for performing data analysis tasks. This criticism stemmed in part from comparisons between the R language and Python. R has a built-in *DataFrame* object that greatly simplified many data analysis tasks. This deficiency was addressed in 2008 by Wes McKinney with the creation of [pandas][1] (the name was originally an abbreviation of panel data), and this module continues to be improved. To quote the pandas documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less\n",
    ">so for data analysis and modeling. pandas helps fill this gap, enabling\n",
    ">you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without\n",
    ">having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas module introduces several new data structures like the `Series`, `DataFrame`, and `Panel` that build on top of existing tools like `NumPy` to speed up data analysis tasks. (`NumPy` stands for \"numerical python\" and the module provides support for many useful numerical operations that we will explore in a future module). The pandas module also provides efficient mechanisms for moving data between in-memory representations and different data formats, including comma separated values (`.csv`) and text files, JSON files, SQL databases, HDF5 format files, and even Excel spreadsheets. Finally, the pandas module also provides support for dealing with missing or incomplete data and aggregating or grouping data.\n",

The `.iloc` command finds data rows based on its position; that is, the sequence in which the rows are found in the `Series`. One way to remember the difference between the two methods is that the `i` in `iloc` stands for the **integer** position to look up. When we created our `tempF` `Series`, we did not specify an index. Therefore, it will have a `RangeIndex` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent row. When we create a `Series` this way, the commands `.loc` and `.iloc` will work identically.
